# giada-sponzilli-bootstrap-portfolio

## Description

This portfolio wants to showcase my skills as a web developer to future employers.
In this application, I rebuilt my previous portfolio using Bootstrap 5.
The website is a skeleton for my future projects. Currently, I have only two coding projects.
The resume button is linked to a google doc.
At the bottom of the page there is a section with my contacts to make it easier for employers who wish to reach out for possible interviews.
The website has been made using bootrstrap 5, flexboxes, variables and pseudo-classes.

The code is deployed at https://giadasponzilli.github.io/giada-sponzilli-bootstrap-portfolio/
